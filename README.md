# Kortez
A custom real-time rendering engine in C++ with a strong focus on modern graphics pipelines rather than full engine tooling. The project is designed as a modular renderer and aims to support advanced computer graphics techniques including physically based rendering (PBR), deferred shading, screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO), and extensible shader-driven workflows. The engine emphasizes clean architecture, low-level graphics API usage, and learning-driven implementation of modern rendering techniques.
## Build
Generate project files/build using CMake. Make a directory called **`build`** at the root and then run
```
cmake ..
```
from that directory. This will generate relevant project files (eg. Visual Studio) which you can then use to build and run.
